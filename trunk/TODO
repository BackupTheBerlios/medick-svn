0.0.3 WishList:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. !! Fix Model by forcing the user to write a dummy static find method.

B. !! Using magick __layout or __common shold be optional.
    Think about AJAX who needs to render some plain text or some complex XML document.

C. Implement Session management
D. Fix && Clean-up Routing System
E. Clean-up test/* folder

General TODO list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Routing Mechanism.
    ! Must choose between some kind of RoR implementation or ivent a new and magick Routing system
    ! On setFailure use a Route as a parameter?
    ! Connect two Routes (a Failure Route and a Route) this way, the Route will know what to expect from Failure.
    
2. Validators + Error messages.
    This task is related with task 1
    
3. Auth.
    This task is related with task 1.
    
4. Caching system.
    This could be done using some sort of isRouteWalked methods.
    this task is related with task 1.
    
5. A new naming convention, so we can use __autoload function.
    Will result in long class names, yet this feature is on hold probably until we will have  namespaces in php.

6. XML template engine (?)
    Not so hard, must be without XSLT since there are a lot  of hosts that don't install this extension.

7. Flash thing.

8. Add a configurator alternative so we can remove (or provide an alternative) the simplexml dependency (XMLConfigurator)
    This way, we will also have to try to avoid the spl crap.
    The work on INIConfigurator is on progress.

9. Generator scripts, for applications, for generating Models/Controllers/Views (fix the old one).
