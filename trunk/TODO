0.0.4 WishList:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. this will be only a code-clean-up release (so no so many features will be added):

    -> fix unit-tests.
    -> remove collection ~like~ classes by adding a core.util API
    
B. !!! medick Web Site, use pmwiki?

C. generator scripts (see task 009).

General TODO list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. (0.0.4-0.0.5) Routing System

2. (0.0.5) Validators + Error messages.
    
3. (0.2.0) A RDBAC System should be implemented by default.
    This task is related with task 1.
    
4. (0.2.0) Caching system.
    This could be done using some sort of isRouteWalked methods.
    this task is related with task 1.
    
5. (0.2.0) A new naming convention, so we can use __autoload function.
    Will result in long class names, yet this feature is on hold probably until we will have  namespaces in php.

6. XML template engine (?)
    Not so hard, must be without XSLT since there are a lot  of hosts that don't install this extension.

7. (0.0.5) Flash thing. depends on Session implementation.

8. (0.0.5) Add a configurator alternative so we can remove (or provide an alternative to) the simplexml dependency (XMLConfigurator)

    This way, we will also have to try to avoid the spl crap.
    The work on INIConfigurator is on progress.
    
    YAML? found a nice php class for parsing: /home/aurelian/Desktop/spyc-0.1.1.tar.gz

9. (0.0.4) Generator scripts, for applications, for generating Models/Controllers/Views (fix the old one).

    Application Generator:
            -> creates a base application skeleton.
            -> name bin/medick.php
    (0.2.0) generator.php
            -> right now our generator it`s outdated.
            -> add more datatypes to scaffold (depends on updating old CLI* classes?).
