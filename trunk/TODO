0.0.3 WishList:
Implement Session management
Fix && Clean-up Routing System

1. Routing Mechanism.
    ! Must choose between some kind of RoR implementation or ivent a new and magick Routing system
    ! On setFailure use a Route as a parameter?
    ! Connect two Routes (a Failure Route and a Route) this way, the Route will know what to expect from Failure.
    
2. Validators.
    2.1 Error messages.
    
3.^ Auth.

4.^ Caching system.
    This could be done using some sort of isRouteWalked methods.
    
5.^ A new naming convention, so we can use __autoload function.
    Will result in long class names, yet this feature is on hold probably until we will have  namespaces in php.

6.^ XML template engine (?)
    Not so hard, must be without XSLT since there are a lot  of hosts that don't install this extension.

7. Flash thing.
